<h1>Rachel Maddow</h1>

<p>Rachel Maddow (born 1973) is the ultimate lesbian pin-up, a polished political commentator, writer and Emmy award-winner who, against the odds, has made a name for herself in the dudes' club of TV news journalism. Maddow's quiet confidence and methodical approach have garnered her millions of viewers who love her habit of ignoring the personalities of politicians and - refreshingly - focusing on their actions instead. It's because of this that people really <em>listen</em> to Maddow. A classic liberal, she leaves furious right-wingers frothing at the mouth, but her meticulous, fact-focused investigations are hard to dispute. And it's all delivered in a delightfully witty, if not subtly ironic way.

<br/><br/>

A perennial outsider, Maddow has an uneasy relationship with celebrity. At high school in California she was a moody teen, and as a young adult, she was especially bookish, graduating Stanford and Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar (the first out gay student to receive the award), and hoping for a life in dusty academia and AIDs activism. It was on a radio show in Massachusetts in 1999 that Maddow first tried her handat broadcast journalism, and in 2008 she drifted into TV news, briefly filling for a more seasonal broadcaster. She was a hit, and later that year, <em>The Rachel Maddow Show</em> first aired.

<br/><br/>

In many ways, Maddow is still an outsider She's one of the few openly gay news journalists in the US ('I do think that if you're gay you have a responsibility to come out,' Maddow has said), and happily dresses 'like a 13 year old boy'. But Maddow doesn't want the focus on herm or her lesbian heart-throb status, but the transformative power of great journalism.</p>

<h1>Armistead Maupin</h1>

<p>Novelist Armistead Maupin born 1944) is the queer Dickens, charting the highs and lows of San Francisco through the lives of a family of beloved characters who have (mostly) survived his ambitious nine-book, decade-spanning <em>Tales of the City</em> literary epic. The millions of readers who have lived, loved and grown old alongside Mouse, Mona, Mary Ann and Mrs Madrigal, have also found themselves submerged in stories of queer urban life, the AIDs crisis (Maupin was one of the first fiction writers to address the illness), trans identity, sex and ageing, Quaaludes and tighty-whitey dance contests.

<br/><br/>

<em>Tales</em> started as a serial in 1974 in a Marin County newspaper and Maupin soon found himself in a gruelling publishing schedule, churning out stories to deadline, weaving in contemporary issues and his own salty experience of the city. Like <em>Vertigo</em>, <em>Bullitt</em> and other iconic San Francisco-set works, Maupin's <em>Tales</em> seemed less to reflect the reality of life in the city as much as add to its mythological status.

<br/><br/>

In 1974, when Mary Ann first discovered Barbary Lane, the fictional boarding house at the centre of the first novels, gay equality barely existed, at least outside of San Francisco. Slowly and steadily, works like <em>Tales</em> played a part in increasing the visibility of queer people. For Maupin, it has always been an intensely personal project; almost autobiographical. 'It was happening to me,' he explains, 'I was coming out to my own parents in the course of writing <em>Tales</em>.' He knew that, to change attitudes, 'all I had to do was to show how much fun it was to live my life, and to tell other people [not to] let that stigma weigh you down.'</p>

<h1>Freddie Mercury</h1>

<p>Wearer of sequined chest-baring one-pieces, eye-wateringly tight tights and bulging wet-look leather, toothy Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 1946-91) was the impossibly camp frontman of legendary pop-rock outfit Queen. As a performer, Mercury would truss himself up in fetish gear with aviators, white vests, denim and studded bicep bands: outfits that seemed to scream gay sex to his adorning - and surprisingly mainstream - fans, who would do little more than titter and tut at his balls-out sexuality.

<br/><br/>

In his early twenties, Mercury performed with a couple of forget-table bands and hawked vintage fashion at London's Kensington Market, finally joining fellow musicians Brian May and Roger Taylor to form Queen in 1970. He penned and performed 'Killer Queen' (1974), 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (1975) and 'Don't Stop Me Now' (1979), balancing a shy offstage persona with an eye-popping on-stage creation - his set with Queen at Live Aid in 1985 is thought of as the landmark rock performance.

<br/><br/>

The tabloid press loved reporting on Mercury's louche lifestyle. His antics filled column inches and grew his celebrity, but it proved a fickle relationship. By 1990, rumours of Mercury's HIV status saw him doorstepped at home and ambushed at airports; hacks who once celebrated Mercury's excess now slut-shamed him and pictures of him looking thin and frail hit the front pages. He died the following year.

<br/><br/>

Although Mercury was criticised for not publicly engaging with lesbian and gay groups and HIV-awareness organisations (he did much to protect his privacy and those around him), he dragged his own version of queerness - in all its scantily clad glory - into the mainstream.</p>

<h1>Harvey Milk</h1>

<p>To 1970s San Francisco and the gay days of handlebar moustaches, steamy bath houses, macram√© and angry, full-blooded street protest. Ultimate queer hero, Harvey Milk (1930-78), was the passionate local business-owner-turned-politician who became the first openly gay person elected to public office in California.

<br/><br/>

Although San Francisco was the epicentre of alternative culture in the US, and the Castro District the spiritual home of queer life, a staunch, religiously-motivated national conservatism hung over the growing gay community. Angry with the entrapment of local gay people, heavy-handed police prosecution and laws limiting the rights of LGBT citizens, Milk decided to run for office.

<br/><br/>

Winning over hearts and minds with his frankness and humour, Milk's dogged rise to power employed the tactical genius of firing up gay voters, forming surprising coalitions and promising to sort out San Francisco's chihuahua poop problem. In 1977, on his third attempt, he finally scored a place on the Board of Supervisors. He burned brightly. In his 11-month reign, he was the driving force behind a gay-rights law that prohibited discrimination, spearheaded programmes to benefit minority groups and the elderly, and helped defeat a state senate proposal to prohibit gay people teaching in public schools in California.

<br/><br/>

On 27th November, 1978, Milk and Mayor Moscone were shot dead by disgruntled former city supervisor, Dan White. At trial, White was found guilty only of voluntary manslaughter, escaping a harsh murder sentence. Furious Milk supporters took part in the city's infamous White Night riots. The following night, thousands took to Castro Street for another reason: to celebrate what would have been Milk's 49th birthday.</p>

<h1>Jake Miller</h1>

<p>Jake Miller (born 1972) is the muscle-bound motivational speaker, trans activist, filmmaker and actor whose rascally alter-ego, Buck Angel, has appeared in hundreds of eye-popping adult movies. His aim? To eroticise the trans body, increase visibility and explore the ins and outs of trans male identity.

<br/><br/>

At school, Miller found it hard to fit in and his journey to transitioning was a difficult one. Testosterone therapy and top surgery followed and Miller started to work on his physique and buffed up. Then came the adult movies. Miller was working behind the scenes, building websites, wondering why there were no transgender men in porn. He decided to change that. No one had seen anything like Buck Angel before and at first, Miller's tattooed on-screen creation found it hard to carve a niche in the industry. But soon, Angel had his own following and his fame grew.

<br/><br/>

In 2012, Miller's work began to evolve from making sweaty, sexy cult movies to education. He now speaks at events around the world, giving his views on sexuality, gender and how wider society perceives non-binary and trans people, along with safe sex advice and feminist perspectives on pornography. And his online documentary series <em>Sexing the Transman</em> (2011) gives a further voice to trans men and their relationship with sex, all in a lo-fi adult movie format.

<br/><br/>

Miller's work - both his adult movies and trans education drive - is unique. It's a careful balancing act to maintain Buck Angel's naughtiness with Miller's own progressive aims, but he enjoys subverting expectations. As he loves to say: 'It's not what's between your legs that defines you.'</p>
