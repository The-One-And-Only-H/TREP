<h1>KD Lang</h1>

<p>“Elvis is alive and she's beautiful,” said Madonna of KD Lang (1961-present). In the mid 90's, Lang's <em>Ingénue</em> (1992), her multi-million-selling, Grammy-winning album, saw her draped in supermodels and celebs, attending fashion shows, falling out of boozy parties - even shot by Herb Ritts for the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em> (1993) being shaved by Cindy Crawford. Lang grew up on the prairie lands of Edmonton and formed a band, The Reclines, in 1983. She worked her own brand of “cowboy punk” in kitsch outfits, started picking up awards, and recorded <em>Crying</em>, a duet with Roy Orbison, in 1987. She then starred in queer cult classic <em>Salmonberries</em> (1991), and the legendary coming out episode of <em>Ellen</em> (1997). After <em>Ingénue</em>, she used her new star power to become a spokesperson for lesbian and gay issues, animal rights and human rights in Tibet.</p>

<h1>Audre Lorde</h1>

<p>Just before her death, poet, feminist and activist Audre Lorde (1934-1992) took a new name in an African naming ceremony. She became known as Gamba Adisa, meaning Warrior: She Who Makes Her Meaning Known. She unpicked the fabric of race, gender and sexuality. “I started writing,” she said, “because I had a need inside of me to create something that was not there.” As a writer and performer, Lorde was deadly serious one minute, and light and coquettish the next. Today, she might be read as an intersectional feminist - holding the belief that oppressive institutions (such as racism and sexism) are interconnected and cannot be examined individually. Lorde was dogged in the fighting of all prejudice, not only in mainstream culture, but within feminism too. Her techniques were powerful, from the unapologetic way she might underline her identity as a “black feminist lesbian mother poet” in readings and debates, to how she might split up her usually all female audiences, asking black women to stay after a performance and introduce themselves, forging new relationships.</p>
