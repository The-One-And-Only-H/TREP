<h1>Radclyffe Hall</h1>

<p>Radclyffe Hall (1880-1943) is mostly known for their novel <em>The Well of Loneliness</em> (1928), a taboo breaking and gender busting literary classic. It charts the life of Stephen, an upper class young woman who finds love in the arms of Mary, an older ambulance driver, only for the pair to suffer isolation and rejection from a cruel world. Hall hoped it might encourage a “more tolerant understanding” of queer people, and thought she had “put [her] pen at the service of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world.” However, she was deemed a “danger to the nation” and Hall's novel was banned four months after publication, after medical advice that it could lead women to become lesbians. It was finally released in 1949. Hall dressed in men's clothing (she wore a leather riding coat and Spanish riding hat to <em>The Well's</em> censorship court case), called herself 'John', lived with her female partner Una Troubridge, and appeared in photographs and artworks in her bespoke, masculine finery.</p>

<h1>Keith Haring</h1>

<p>Keith Haring (1958-1990) is the bespectacled subway scrawler whose cartoonish drawings of birth, death, love, sex and freedom became synonymous with the creative renaissance of 1980's New York. Through hundreds of works created in white chalk across the NYC transport system and beyond, Haring's raw, vibrant style marked him out as a queer, sex positive artist who dealt in social justice. Befriending artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, as well as graffiti writers, and performers like Fab 5 Freddy and Madonna, Haring became a major figure on the scene. Four years after arriving in New York, Haring's first major show attracted the likes of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. Soon, he was travelling the world creating new works for hospitals, children's centres and charities, and took part in more than 100 solo and group exhibitions. In 1988, Haring was diagnosed with AIDs and the following year set up the Keith Haring Foundation to provide funding and artworks to AIDs organisations. He died one year later at the age of 31. Haring's imagery played a huge part in the activism and awareness surrounding AIDs. To this day, his foundation supports not-for-profits that help under-privileged children and organisations that focus on AIDs education, prevention and care.</p>

<h1>Essex Hemphill</h1>

<p>Essex Hemphill (1957-1995) is the gay poet and activist whose angry, explicit, autobiographical works tackled anti-gay attitudes, sexual objectification and racism, and helped define the experience of black gay men during the AIDs epidemic. It was during a reading at Howard University, Washington in 1980 that he first talked about being gay. His sensual, erotic poems and essays dealt with the anti-gay mindset of straight black men and the objectification of black men by the white gay community. Hemphill criticised the work of celebrated queer photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, pointing out his images of black men were all dick and no face. He also critqued Jennie Livingston's legendary 1990 drag doc <em>Paris is Burning</em>, noting that the black drag performer's sassy imitations were “materialistic, Caucasian and consumer” in nature. In the late 80's, Hemphill brought energetic, visceral performances of his own work to small Washington DC venues, and later to New York and London. His editing of anthology <em>Brother to Brother</em> (1991) won a Lambda literary award and his first full length book, <em>Ceremonies</em> (1992), picked up the National Library Association's Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual New Author Award.</p>

<h1>Patricia Highsmith</h1>

<p>In 1952, using the pseudonym Claire Morgan, Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995), published <em>The Price of Salt</em>, a novel that draws on her own entanglements with former lovers in the glamorous 1950’s Greenwich Village. Graduating from women's liberal arts college Barnard in 1942, Highsmith wrote short stories and comics, and struggled to secure a job in journalism. Encouraged by Truman Capote, in 1948 Highsmith gained a place on the Yaddo arts retreat where she worked on her first novel, the best selling <em>Strangers on a Train</em> (1950). A year later, Hitchcock released the movie version. “The poet of apprehension” is how Graham  Greene once described Highsmith's writing. She wrote more than 20 novels, inspiring big budget movie adaptations, created iconic characters like Tom Ripley, and apparently had time to break hearts across New York. <em>The Price of Salt</em> was inspired by an icy blonde woman in a mink whom Highsmith spotted while working at Bloomingdales as a young shop girl, much like the character Therese in the novel. Thirty eight years after its debut, near the end of Highsmith's life, the world had changed. Highsmith decided that <em>Salt</em>, her most personal novel, be republished as <em>Carol</em> (1990), but this time under her real name.</p>

<h1>Rock Hudson</h1>

<p>Rock Hudson (1925-1985) is the impossibly handsome screen idol of Hollywood's golden age who - like many of his contemporaries - infamously hid his sexuality from plain sight. Director Douglas Sirk gave Hudson his first starring role in <em>Magnificent Obsession</em> (1954), but his star power became obvious after the release of <em>Giant</em> (1956), which scored him an Oscar nomination. Later in his career, Hudson appeared in a handful of films, but by the early 1980's his health had deteriorated. Then came a turning point: in 1985, Hudson announced he had HIV. The idea that a beloved national treasure like Hudson could have AIDs was a huge shock, but Hudson's bravery in finally speaking out helped to de-stigmatise the illness, and opened up dialogue about what it meant to be gay in contemporary America. He died the same year.</p>
