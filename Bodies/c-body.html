    <h1>Laverne Cox</h1>

    <p>“I'm a black transgender chick from Mobile, Alabama, I grew up poor and working class, and I'm on the cover of magazines,” says actor, performer, writer, producer and civil rights activist Laverne Cox (1972-present). In 2013, popular TV drama <em>Orange is the New Black</em> launched Cox into the mainstream, and she has since appeared on talk shows, awards ceremonies and lectures. <em>Time</em> magazine called it a “tipping point” for the trans community when they put Cox on the cover in 2014. Cox has used her celebrity status to shine a light on other members of the trans community, incarcerated sex workers and teens battling bathroom bills.</p>

    <h1>Quentin Crisp</h1>

    <p>Quentin Crisp (1908-99) was a pastel hued queer creature of the likes unseen on the streets of south London with a little lipstick here and a dab of nail polish there. In his twenties, Crisp struggled to hold down a job, studying journalism and art and, through hanging out in the cafes of Soho, became a sex worker too. Escaping conscription because of “sexual perversion”, Crisp loved wartime London and his affection for US culture apparently stemmed from his night time fumbles with American GIs. Crisp published three short books and by 1968 he was the subject of a documentary, but it was the 1975 film adaptation of Crisp's <em>The Naked Civil Servant</em> starring John Hurt that secured the raconteur's stardom. He toured a show about his life and moved to New York in 1981. Crisp seemed at odds with contemporary gay liberation rhetoric, and when challenged, hardened his views. In his final years, he failed to grasp the shift in attitudes towards queer civil equality. To him, the AIDs crisis was “a fad” and gay men had “feminine minds”.</p>
