<h1>Camille Paglia</h1>

<p>Camille Paglia (1947-present) is an academic and critic tackling social theories, pop culture icons and the works of her contemporaries. Paglia graduated from Binghamton University, New York in 1968 as valedictorian and is thought to be the first openly gay woman at Yale Graduate School from 1968-72. Finding her voice, she developed new theories of sexual history, popular culture and art, and continued to argue with her idols. Paglia became a professor at the University of Arts in Philadelphia in 1984 and has been one of academia's strongest, loudest voices ever since. Her writing is camp, comic and salacious; pro-sex, art, fashion, beauty and Hollywood; and her explosive book <em>Sexual Personae</em> (1990) made sure she was at the centre of the culture wars in the 90's.</p>
