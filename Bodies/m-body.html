<h1>Rachel Maddow</h1>

<p>Rachel Maddow (1973-present) is a political commentator, writer and Emmy award winner whose quiet confidence and methodical approach have garnered her millions of viewers who love her habit of ignoring the personalities of politicians and - refreshingly - focusing on their actions instead. A classic liberal, she leaves furious right wingers frothing at the mouth, but her meticulous, fact focused investigations are hard to dispute. And it's all delivered in a delightfully witty, if not subtly ironic way. Maddow graduated at Stanford and Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar (the first openly gay student to receive the award). It was on a radio show in Massachusetts in 1999 that Maddow first tried her hand at broadcast journalism and in 2008 she drifted into TV news. Later that year, <em>The Rachel Maddow Show</em> first aired. She's one of the few openly gay news journalists in the US. “I do think that if you're gay you have a responsibility to come out,” Maddow has said.</p>

<h1>Armistead Maupin</h1>

<p>Novelist Armistead Maupin (1944-present) is the queer Dickens, known for his literary epic <em>Tales of the City</em>. The millions of readers have found themselves submerged in stories of queer urban life, the AIDs crisis, trans identity, sex and ageing. <em>Tales</em> started as a serial in 1974 in a Marin County newspaper and Maupin soon found himself in a gruelling publishing schedule, churning out stories to deadline, weaving in contemporary issues and his own salty experience of the city. Slowly and steadily, works like <em>Tales</em> played a part in increasing the visibility of queer people. For Maupin, it has always been an intensely personal project; almost autobiographical. “It was happening to me,” he explains, “I was coming out to my own parents in the course of writing <em>Tales</em>.” He knew that, to change attitudes, “all I had to do was to show how much fun it was to live my life, and to tell other people [not to] let that stigma weigh you down.”</p>

<h1>Freddie Mercury</h1>

<p>Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara, 1946-1991) was the impossibly camp frontman of legendary pop rock band Queen. As a performer, Mercury would truss himself up in fetish gear with aviators, white vests, denim and studded bicep bands: outfits that seemed to scream gay to his adorning fans. In his early twenties, Mercury performed with a couple of bands and hawked vintage fashion at London's Kensington Market, finally joining fellow musicians Brian May and Roger Taylor to form Queen in 1970. He penned and performed 'Killer Queen' (1974), 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (1975) and 'Don't Stop Me Now' (1979). His set with Queen at Live Aid in 1985 is thought of as the landmark rock performance. The tabloid press loved reporting on Mercury's lifestyle. By 1990, rumours of Mercury's HIV status saw him doorstepped at home and ambushed at airports; hacks who once celebrated Mercury's excess now slut shamed him and pictures of him looking thin and frail hit the front pages. He died the following year.</p>

<h1>Harvey Milk</h1>

<p>Harvey Milk (1930-1978) was the passionate local business owner turned politician who became the first openly gay person elected to public office in California. Although San Francisco was the epicentre of alternative culture in the US, and the Castro District the spiritual home of queer life, a religiously motivated national conservatism hung over the growing gay community. Angry with the entrapment of local gay people, heavy handed police prosecution and laws limiting the rights of LGBTQ citizens, Milk decided to run for office. In 1977, he finally scored a place on the Board of Supervisors. In his 11 month reign, he was the driving force behind a gay rights law that prohibited discrimination, spearheaded programmes to benefit minority groups and the elderly, and helped defeat a state senate proposal to prohibit gay people teaching in public schools in California. On 27th November, 1978, Milk and Mayor Moscone were shot dead by disgruntled former city supervisor, Dan White. At trial, White was found guilty only of voluntary manslaughter, escaping a harsh murder sentence. Furious Milk supporters took part in the city's infamous White Night riots. The following night, thousands took to Castro Street for another reason: to celebrate what would have been Milk's 49th birthday.</p>

<h1>Jake Miller</h1>

<p>Jake Miller (1972-present) is the muscular motivational speaker, trans activist, filmmaker and actor whose alter ego, Buck Angel, has appeared in hundreds of adult movies. His goal is to eroticise the trans body, increase visibility and explore the ins and outs of trans male identity. Miller was working behind the scenes in the adult entertainment industry, building websites whilst wondering why there were no transgender men in porn. In 2012, Miller's work began to evolve from making sweaty, sexy cult movies to education. He now speaks at events around the world, giving his views on sexuality, gender and how wider society perceives non-binary and trans people, along with safe sex advice and feminist perspectives on pornography. And his online documentary series <em>Sexing the Transman</em> (2011) gives a further voice to trans men and their relationship with sex, all in a lo-fi adult movie format. As he loves to say: “It's not what's between your legs that defines you.”</p>
