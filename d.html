<h1>Candy Darling</h1>

<p><em>Candy Says</em> (1969) is Lou Reed's lullaby-soft tribute to glittering Warhol superstar Candy Darling, written at the height of her fame. The glamorous trans woman, actress and scenester died five years later. She was just 29.

<br/><br/>

Born James Slattery, Darling (1944-4) spent her Long Island childhood obsessed with old Hollywood movies. She became skilled at mimicking the leading ladies that flickered on the screen and dreamed of being just like them. Darling enrolled at beauty school and began hanging out at the local gay hotspot. When her mother challenged her about rumours that her son was gay and a cross-dresser, Darling promptly went to her room, only to reappear in a dress. Or so the legend goes.

<br/><br/>

From then on, Darling dressed as she pleased. She'd travel into Manhattan, hanging out in Greenwich Village, making influential arty friends, changing her name numerous times until Candy Darling stuck. Warhol was fascinated with Darling and cast her in his film projects; she became a fixture at Warhol's Factory and soon found herself with something of a theatre and art-house movie career. Her short life was studded with celeb names and she became the muse of The Velvet Underground (as well as <em>Candy Says</em>, Darling is also name-checked in the Lou Reed's 1972 track <em>Walk on the Wild Side</em>).

<br/><br/>

Before she passed away after suffering lymphoma, she penned a letter to her friends. In it she said: 'I know I could've been a star but I decided I didn't want it.' But it seems that's just what she achieved. Call her what you will: a trans pioneer, a talented actress, the most glamorous member of the Factory; she was a true leading lady.</p>

<h1>Ellen DeGeneres</h1>

<p>Ellen DeGeneres (born 1958) is a mile-a-minute, high-energy comic, talk show host, actor and business-leader whose infamous refusal of a puppy caused a seismic shift in attitudes towards queer people on TV - and pop culture at large.

<br/><br/>

Born in Louisiana, DeGeneres was waitressing and bartending when she started to perform comedy in cafes and clubs. Soon she began touring her stand-up gig and was named Showtime's Funniest Person in America in 1982; a meandering career in TV finally lead to her scoring her own sitcom in 1994, inspired in part by her comedy routines. But in 1997, her primetime ABC show, <em>Ellen</em>, was in crisis. DeGeneres wanted her character to come out on air but, after months of negotiations with reluctant TV execs, it was suggested she get a puppy instead. DeGeneres had come out herself on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, but for her sitcom character to do the same would have been a landmark (read: contentious) moment in TV history. She refused the puppy and, eventually, the network relented. The star-studded two-parter attracted 42 million viewers and led to advertiser boycotts, an Emmy and the eventual cancellation of <em>Ellen's</em> third season.

<br/><br/>

But what effect did DeGeneres' steadfastness ultimately have? At the time, she represented a painfully wholesome queerness - all tapestry waistcoats, cute sweaters, glossy bangs and neuroses - she was easy to love. But placing a gay main character on primetime TV, and into the homes of millions, had never been done, and helped to change attitudes towards LGBT+ people. More gay characters turned up on America's favourite shows, queer sitcom <em>Will & Grace</em> launched and became NBC's best-rated series, and today there are more gay people on TV than ever. As sweetly unthreatening as DeGeneres' queerness may have been, she arguably did as much for gay people as any politician or activist of the time. Just don't mention the puppy.</p>

<h1>Marlene Dietrich</h1>

<p>Much has been written about the odd morals of old Hollywood: how our favourite, butter-wouldn't-melt film stars lived altogether more unexpected, extraordinarily naughty lives off screen. According to historians, legendary German actor and singer Marlene Dietrich (1901-92) was no exception.

<br/><br/>

The star of <em>Dishonoured</em> (1931), <em>Shanghai Express</em> (1932) and <em>Blonde Venus</em> (1932) was a young upstart in the Berlin theatrical community before moving to the US. After World War I, a wonderfully decadent period of sexual exploration and creative freedom took hold in the uneasy Weimar Republic. It was there Dietrich's sexual confidence was unleashed; there are bawdy stories of backstage liaisons, sticky affairs and the underwear of beautiful women ripped clean off (it was Dietrich who did the ripping). And it was during the filming of <em>The Joyless Street</em> (1925) that Dietrich and screen star Greta Garbo are said to have had a torrid affair, although the pair claimed not to know each other after their Hollywood reinvention.

<br/><br/>

There is something deliciously defiant about Dietrich. Unwavering self-belief saw her roll her eyes at conventional notions of gender and sex: she studied boxing, wore men's clothes , bedded the world's most beautiful women and apparently slept with three Kennedys. In fact, Dietrich slept with anyone she wanted to. She once claimed: 'In Europe, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman - we make love to anyone we find attractive.'

<br/><br/>

Stories of Dietrich's antics - gossip, snobbery, competitiveness - seem to reveal a cruel character, but there was (even) more hidden behind the fa√ßade. In the late 30's, Dietrich and other high profile Germans set up a fund to help Jews and others escape the war, and in 1937 she donated her entire fee for <em>Knight Without Armour</em> to the refugees.</p>

<h1>Michael Dillon</h1>

<p>Gender warrior, doctor, writer, surgical pioneer, hero of the Blitz and Buddhist monk, Michael Dillon (1915-62) lived many lives. He grew up with his brother and two aunts in Kent, England, graduated from Oxford (where he was president of the boat club) and took a job in a research lab. It would have been a rather calm existence had Michael ignored his true nature and not started the process of female to male transition.

<br/><br/>

Born Laura, Dillon had always lived as a woman, but as war broke out in Europe in 1939, he decided to start testosterone treatment. He worked in a garage, passed as male and became a fire-watcher during the Blitz. He came to the attention of plastic surgeon Harold Gillies who, over the years, helped Dillon achieve a male body. In the meantime, Dillon studied medicine, changed his birth certificate and worked hard to hide the paper trail that stated he was a woman.

<br/><br/>

Reading between the lines, bookish Dillon might have preferred a quieter existence, but his bravery in transforming his life, and others, meant he experienced something rather different. He helped Roberta Cowell become Britain's first trans woman to receive gender realignment surgery in 1951 and published a book about the experience. But in 1959, the press discovered Dillon had been born with a female body, and the resulting attention pushed Dillon to escape to India. There, he finally settled into a quiet life, studied Buddhist teachings, became ordained and died in 1962.</p>

<h1>Divine</h1>

<p>To understand Divine (1945-88), look no further than the man who unleashed her: cult filmmaker John Waters, known affectionately as the 'Pope of Trash'. As the director of low-budget gross-out flicks like <em>Pink Flamingos</em> (1972), Waters put Divine in front of the camera and allowed the wonderfully grotesque drag superstar to do her worst.

<br/><br/>

Divine, or rather Harris Glenn Milstead, spent most of his childhood in Lutherville, Maryland, then a crushingly humdrum and conservative American suburb. Plump and girlish, Glenn was bullied at school, finally finding friendship via his neighbour, amateur filmmaker Waters. Together, they created Divine, a big bag girl from the wrong side of the tracks. All bravado and bosoms, the dangerous drag monster first appeared in Waters' 1966 film <em>Roman Candles</em> and then <em>Eat Your Makeup</em> (1968). Divine helped Glenn reveal a hidden, hawkish talent, hell-bent on notoriety.

<br/><br/>

Through more films and appearances, Waters and Divine's gnarly audience of counterculture freaks and geeks grew into a devoted following, and a star was born. Theatre followed, more cinematic work, trash pop music releases, health challenges, debt and then Waters' <em>Hairspray</em> (1988), where Divine was convinced to drop her glamour look to play tragi-comic character Edna Turnblad to huge acclaim. Through all this, Glenn wished for an acting career of his own, away from Divine, yet successful auditions rarely secured him a role. Finally, in 1988, he achieved his dream: a spot on the comedy show <em>Married... With Children</em>. Sadly, Glenn died of an enlarged heart the night before filming.

<br/><br/>

Although the infamous scene in <em>Pink Flamingos</em> where Divine eats dog poop seems to be Glenn's career-defining moment, perhaps we should first remember his jaw-dropping mastery of gender, taste, high camp and a brazen, busty queerness.</p>
