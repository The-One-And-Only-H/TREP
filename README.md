# TREP
Welcome to The Rainbow Encyclopedia Project: a dynamic list of history's most prominent members of the LGBTQ community.

The Rainbow Encyclopedia Project or TREP is my first ever project. During my studies as a baby programmer, I reached the point where it was time to build my first project. But what was I going to build? I decided to pick a topic close to my heart: LGBTQ history.

I wanted to create an engaging and accessible resource for others to be able to learn more about the community and it's roots so I decided to construct a directory of important figureheads. Utilising visually pleasing CSS stylings and fun bits of JS and jQuery, I successfully achieved my goal.

Alongside my various studies at the time, I came across Python and felt compelled to put my knowledge of this language to use. This project includes the first Python script I ever deployed, which made me fall in love with the language.

This project is currently a WIP, but you can view it here: https://the-one-and-only-h.github.io/TREP/
