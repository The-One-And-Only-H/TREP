<h1>Allen Ginsberg</h1>

<p>Allen Ginsberg (1926-97) is the frizz-haired beat poet known for his deliciously filthy, potent writing that dealt in sweaty, man-on-man sex with a shocking frankness (his 1968 poem 'Please Master' is a real eyebrow-raiser).

<br/><br/>

As a young geeky teenager in New Jersey, Ginsberg would read Walt Whitman and write letters about political issues to <em>The New York Times</em>, but it was in 1943 at Columbia University, New York, that he met William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. Drugs, drink, sex, handling stolen goods - and writing - followed. In 1954, he moved to San Francisco, and it's there, because of Ginsberg and his friends, that the Beat Movement flourished. Two years later, Ginsberg published 'Howl', his great gift to the world. The rambling poem is an outcry of rage at the state of post-war America, splicing pop culture with the literary avant-garde, and made Ginsberg famous (not least because it became the subject of an obscenity trial in 1957).

<br/><br/>

For Ginsberg, exploring the outer limits of human intellect, and living a radical, non-conformist life, was everything. Loving other men, and rising above sexual repression, was an essential part of this. And didn't he love to talk about it: he was deported from Cuba in 1965 for protesting about the government's persecution of gay people and describing Che Guevara as 'cute'.

<br/><br/>

Ginsberg met fellow poet Peter Orlovsky in 1954, and they stayed together in a loose, loving partnership for 43 years until Ginsberg's death in 1997. There was nothing private about Ginsberg, no secrets. Even in his later years, he would travel the world, give readings and flirt with young men at after parties. His was a bawdy, passionate and eventful life lived large.</p>

<h1>Barbara Gittings</h1>

<p>Barbara Gittings (1932-2007) is the civil rights pioneer who, with her partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen (the first gay photojournalist), campaigned for gay equality for almost 46 years, founding the first ever national lesbian organisation and coming out in the couple's assisted-living facility newsletter.

<br/><br/>

In the late 1950's, very few gay people came out, but Gittings didn't get the memo. She was a highly visible, passionate and militant lesbian activist who founded the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis and edited <em>The Ladder</em>, the nation's first lesbian rag, from 1963-66. She was at early gay rights demos at the White House in the 60's to end discrimination against gay people in federal employment. And in the early 70's, Gittings helped lobby the American Psychiatric Association, protesting at meetings, grabbing the microphone and eventually appearing on panels arguing that the APA should remove its definition of homosexuality as a mental disorder (she succeeded in 1973).

<br/><br/>

Almost always on the front line, Gittings worked hard in the background too: she campaigned for public libraries to increase information about gay life, inspired by the lack thereof when she was growing up. As a teenager, her father caught her reading Radclyffe Hall's <em>The Well of Loneliness</em> (and promptly asked her to burn it), but there was little else in libraries to help or inspire her. She set about changing all that.

<br/><br/>

For many, Gittings is the grande dame of modern LGBT+ rights movement. In their seventies, Gittings and Lahusen moved into an assisted-living apartment and one of their last acts was to come out in the centre's newsletter. Gittings remained outspoken, proud of who she was, right until the end.</p>
