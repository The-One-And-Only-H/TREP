<h1>Camille Paglia</h1>

<p>Camille Paglia (born 1947) is an unstoppable force. The academic, critic and all-round queer badass rips apart social theories, devours pop culture icons and destroys the hallowed works of her contemporaries - nothing and no one is untouchable. Just watch her in action: her energetic, rapid-fire discourse reveals a brain fizzing with ideas, cryptic references, wry jokes - and she leave very few gaps for questions.

<br/><br/>

Paglia graduated from Binghamton University, New York, in 1968 as valedictorian (even though she had proudly been on probation for a series of pranks), and is thought to be the first openly gay woman at Yale Graduate School from 1968-72. Finding her voice, she developed new theories of sexual history, popular culture and art, and continued to argue with her idols, leaving her first teaching post after a period of intense feather-ruffling. Paglia became a professor at the University of Arts in Philadelphia in 1984, and has been one of academia's strongest, loudest voices ever since. Her writing is camp, comic and salacious; pro-sex, art, fashion, beauty and Hollywood; and her explosive book <em>Sexual Personae</em> (1990) made sure she was at the centre of the culture wars in the 90's.

<br/><br/>

Today, Paglia remains at odds with contemporary feminism and is searingly blunt with her criticism. Her academic legacy? Ultimately, she perceives herself a truth-teller; a champion of free-thinking and the independent mind, and her ideas continue to be impassioned and divisive. She is as wonderfully loud-mouthed as ever.</p>
