<h1>Christopher Isherwood</h1>

<p>If there was ever a writer who could expertly conjure a deliciously pent-up, awkward sexuality, it is Christopher Isherwood (1904-86). The author of <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> (1939) and <em>A Single Man</em> (1964) published his personal diaries late in life, which proved even more salacious and exciting than his fictional creations.

<br/><br/>

As a teen, Isherwood was more than a little precocious. He churned out stories and poems, created a literary fantasy world with is friend Edward Upward, and wrote plays with WH Auden. Asked to leave Cambridge University after deliberately ruining his exam paper, Isherwood spent a brief spell studying medicine before heading off where any self-respecting upper-middle class gay man would in 1929: to Weimar Berlin. By all accounts he threw himself crotch-first into the city's decadent, bohemian lifestyle and spent a lost, steamy summer exploring his sexuality. Years later, in <em>Christopher and His Kind</em> (1976), Isherwood revealed the story of a contemporary (and sexually accomplished) queer hero.

<br/><br/>

For a small man, Isherwood lived big: he travelled extensively and intrepidly, had sticky love affairs, became a practising Hindu, and wrote prolifically. <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em> was reworked by John Van Druten for the stage play <em>I Am a Camera</em> (1951), which was later adapted into the hugely successful musical <em>Cabaret</em> (1966). Isherwood's fame grew, but by 1953, he had other things on his mind and fell in love with 18 year old college student, Don Bachardy. After a tricky patch that inspired Isherwood's <em>A Single Man</em>, one of his finest works, the pair stayed together until Isherwood's death in 1986.</p>
