    <h1>Candy Darling</h1>

    <p><em>Candy Says</em> (1969) is Lou Reed's tribute to Warhol’s superstar Candy Darling (1944-1974), written at the height of her fame. The glamorous trans woman, actress and scenester died five years later. She was just 29. Darling enrolled at beauty school and began hanging out at the local gay hotspot. When her mother challenged her about rumours that her son was gay and a cross-dresser, Darling promptly went to her room, only to reappear in a dress. Or so the legend goes. From then on, Darling dressed as she pleased. She'd travel into Manhattan, hanging out in Greenwich Village, making influential arty friends, changing her name numerous times until Candy Darling stuck. Warhol was fascinated with Darling and cast her in his film projects. She became a fixture at Warhol's Factory and soon found herself with something of a theatre and art house movie career. Her short life was studded with celebrity names and she became the muse of The Velvet Underground (as well as <em>Candy Says</em>, Darling is also name checked in the Lou Reed's 1972 track <em>Walk on the Wild Side</em>). </p>

    <h1>Ellen DeGeneres</h1>

    <p>Ellen DeGeneres (1958-present) is a high energy comic, talk show host, actor and business leader. Born in Louisiana, DeGeneres was waitressing and bartending when she started to perform comedy in cafes and clubs. Soon she began touring her stand up gig and was named Showtime's Funniest Person in America in 1982. She later scored her own sitcom in 1994, inspired in part by her comedy routines. But in 1997, her primetime ABC show, <em>Ellen</em>, was in crisis. DeGeneres wanted her character to come out on air despite months of negotiations with reluctant TV execs. DeGeneres had come out herself on <em>The Oprah Winfrey Show</em>, but for her sitcom character to do the same would have been a landmark moment in TV history. Placing a gay main character on primetime TV, and into the homes of millions, had never been done, and helped to change attitudes towards LGBTQ people. More gay characters turned up on America's favourite shows, queer sitcom <em>Will & Grace</em> launched and became NBC's best rated series, and today there are more gay people on TV than ever. </p>

    <h1>Marlene Dietrich</h1>

    <p>Marlene Dietrich (1901-1992) was the star of <em>Dishonoured</em> (1931), <em>Shanghai Express</em> (1932) and <em>Blonde Venus</em> (1932). She was a young upstart in the Berlin theatrical community before moving to the US. After World War I, a wonderfully decadent period of sexual exploration and creative freedom took hold in the uneasy Weimar Republic. It was there Dietrich's sexual confidence was unleashed. And it was during the filming of <em>The Joyless Street</em> (1925) that Dietrich and screen star Greta Garbo are said to have had a torrid affair, although the pair claimed not to know each other after their Hollywood reinvention. Unwavering self belief saw her roll her eyes at conventional notions of gender and sex: she studied boxing, wore men's clothes , bedded the world's most beautiful women and apparently slept with three Kennedys. She once claimed: “In Europe, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman - we make love to anyone we find attractive”. In the late 30's, Dietrich and other high profile Germans set up a fund to help Jews and others escape the war, and in 1937 she donated her entire fee for <em>Knight Without Armour</em> to the refugees.</p>

    <h1>Michael Dillon</h1>

    <p>Gender warrior, doctor, writer, surgical pioneer, hero of the Blitz and Buddhist monk, Michael Dillon (1915-1962) lived many lives. He grew up with his brother and two aunts in Kent, England, graduated from Oxford and took a job in a research lab. As war broke out in Europe in 1939, he decided to start testosterone treatment. He worked in a garage, passed as male and became a fire watcher during the Blitz. He came to the attention of plastic surgeon Harold Gillies who, over the years, helped Dillon achieve a male body. In the meantime, Dillon studied medicine, changed his birth certificate and worked hard to hide the paper trail that would identify him as trans. He helped Roberta Cowell become Britain's first trans woman to receive gender realignment surgery in 1951 and published a book about the experience. But in 1959, the press discovered Dillon was trans too, and the resulting attention pushed Dillon to escape to India. There, he finally settled into a quiet life, studied Buddhist teachings, became ordained and died in 1962.</p>

    <h1>Divine</h1>

    <p>To understand Divine (1945-1988), look no further than the man who unleashed her: cult filmmaker John Waters, known affectionately as the “Pope of Trash”. As the director of low budget gross out flicks like <em>Pink Flamingos</em> (1972), Waters put Divine in front of the camera and allowed her to do her worst. Glenn was bullied at school, finally finding friendship via his neighbour, amateur filmmaker Waters. Together, they created Divine, a big bad girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Divine first appeared in Waters' 1966 film <em>Roman Candles</em> and then <em>Eat Your Makeup</em> (1968). Theatre followed, more cinematic work, trash pop music releases, health challenges, debt and then Waters' <em>Hairspray</em> (1988), where Divine was convinced to drop her glamour look to play tragi-comic character Edna Turnblad to huge acclaim. Through all this, Glenn wished for an acting career of his own, away from Divine, yet successful auditions rarely secured him a role. Finally, in 1988, he achieved his dream: a spot on the comedy show <em>Married... With Children</em>. Sadly, Glenn died of an enlarged heart the night before filming.</p>
