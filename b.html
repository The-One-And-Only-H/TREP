<h1>James Baldwin</h1>

<p>James Baldwin (1924-87) was an American queer writer, essayist and social commentator. He was the voice of the American civil rights movement of the late 50's and 60's. He published his first novel <em>Go Tell It on the Mountain</em> in 1953 followed by his essays <em>Notes from a Native Son</em> two years later. In 1956, <em>Giovanni's Room</em> was published, a study of gay shame and malaise across the bars and backrooms of Paris. Baldwin criticised black Christian culture and attacked the literary works of his forebears. As someone who was openly queer, he was consequently set apart in a civil rights movement that was often hostile towards gay people. Readers who expected him to write about the African-American experience found Baldwin's friendship with establishment figures like Norman Mailer, and works like <em>Giovanni's Room</em> with its white gay characters, a little unsettling. Despite this, Baldwin remained steadfast in his beliefs.<p>

<h1>Alison Bechdel</h1>

<p>Alison Bechdel (1960-present) is an American cartoonist known for her long-running strip <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em> (1983-2008), her celebrated memoirs <em>Fun Home</em> (2006) and <em>Are You My Mother?</em> (2012). Bechdel realised she was gay as a student at Oberlin College, Ohio in 1981, whilst simultaneously discovering that her father was bisexual before he soon after passed away. The autobiographical <em>Fun Home</em> tells of a coming out story compounded by the tragedy of losing a parent who hid away their true identity. After moving to New York in 1981, Bechdel came across a copy of <em>Gay Comix</em>, a compilation of comic art by gay men and lesbians, and felt inspired to do it herself. For 25 years, <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em> depicted American lesbian culture, and it was here that she introduced the Bechdel Test, which a film or book can only pass if it features two women who have a conversation about something other than a man. This is now widely used to point out sexism within todays media.</p>

<h1>Gladys Bentley</h1>

<p>Gladys Bentley (1907-1960) sang her way to fame as a big, black, openly gay woman who dressed up in men's clothes. Bentley became the star of the shadowy prohibition underworld. By the late 20's, Bentley had recorded a number of 78s alongside her own radio show. In 1931, rumour had it that Bentley had got engaged to a white woman in New Jersey decades before same sex marriage was legalised. However, Bentley’s life drastically changed according to a 1954 article in <em>Ebony</em> magazine where she attempted to destroy her gay persona. Suddenly, she had married a man and appeared in a photoshoot doing household chores. Despite this, her larger than life personality still resonates with the gay community to this day.</p>

<h1>Justin Vivian Bond</h1>

<p>Award winning performer, artist, writer and activist Justin Vivian Bond (1963-present) has sparkled in the spotlight for more than three decades. Crooning in the smoky dive bars, draped across a piano wailing out <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> or <em>Space Oddity</em>, Bond's creation Kiki DuRane became a cult figure on the 90's and 00's cabaret circuit as one half of award winning act Kiki & Herb. Bond stood for trans expression, non-binary language and choosing one’s own pronouns, as well as acting as a feminist champion and civil rights activist.</p>

<h1>Leigh Bowery</h1>

<p>"Modern art on legs" is how Boy George once described Leigh Bowery (1961-1994), the voluptuous fashion icon and performance artist. Born in Sunshine, Australia Bowery was lured to London by the burgeoning post-punk scene and set about constructing a new, polka-dotted, queer persona for himself. From giving birth on stage to performing an enema on himself, and then spraying down the audience, Bowery delighted and infuriated in equal measure. Stories of the 1980's London creative scene always seem to have Bowery at the heart: his short lived club night Taboo, a two week stint at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery where he posed behind a two way mirror, and becoming the muse of painter Lucien Freud who, it is said, was romanced by Bowery's legs. Defying convention at every turn, Bowery powered his art, design and everyday existence with an unshakable sense of self. Bowery described himself as gay, but married his long time friend Nicola Bateman in 1994, months before his death from an AIDs related illness on New Year's Eve.</p>
