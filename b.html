<h1>James Baldwin</h1>

<p>James Baldwin (1924-87) is the late, great American queer writer, essayist and social commentator. To many, he was the voice of the American civil rights struggle of the late 50's and 60's. As his contemporaries like Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and activist Medgar Evers were murdered, and a bomb blasted through a church in Alabama, his was one of the loudest, angriest screams against racism.

<br/><br/>

Baldwin grew up in Harlem. He excelled at school, loved writing and was mentored by black Greenwich Village painter Beauford Delaney, who helped Baldwin realise a black person could be an artist. So he wrote. At 24, he escaped New York and its woeful opportunities for black men, and moved to France. He published his first novel <em>Go Tell It on the Mountain</em> in 1953 and his essays <em>Notes from a Native Son</em> appeared two years later. Then came <em>Giovanni's Room</em> (1956),  study of gay shame and malaise across the bars and backrooms of Paris.

<br/><br/>

Baldwin was completely uncompromising. White pro-equality liberals found his anger - incandescent at times - shocking. And black activists found Baldwin  problematic ally; he criticised black Christian culture, attacked the literary works of his forebears, and his queerness set him apart in a civil rights movement that was often hostile towards gay people. Readers who expected him to write about the African-American experience found Baldwin's friendship with establishment figures like Norman Mailer, and works like <em>Giovanni's Room</em> with its white gay characters, a little unsettling.

<br/><br/>

Throughout his life, Baldwin remained steadfast in his beliefs, and was completely open about his queerness,however uncomfortable that made others. Most of all, he was a gifted writer, flamboyant one minute, and delicately nuanced the next. With its themes of race, sexuality and alienation, his work has taken on a peculiar poignancy in modern times.</p>

<h1>Alison Bechdel</h1>

<p>Alison Bechdel (1960) is a 'Dyke to Watch Out For'. The impossibly geeky American cartoonist's long-running strip <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em> (1983-2008) and celebrated memoirs <em>Fun Home</em> (2006) and <em>Are You My Mother?</em> (2012) mark her out as a unique queer artist and important cultural voice.

<br/><br/>

Bechdel drew comic-like art from a young age, found gender confounding and struggled to see a girl like herself reflected in contemporary culture. She realised she was gay as a student at Oberlin College, Ohio, in 1981, but this sudden awareness proved tricky. Around the same time, Bechdel discovered her father was bisexual - and deeply closeted - before he suddenly died. The autobiographical <em>Fun Home</em> deals with this unique situation: a coming-out story compounded by the tragedy of losing a parent who hid away their true desires. Moving to New York in 1981, Bechdel threw herself headfirst into the city's vibrant queer subculture of underground dance clubs and steamy lesbian meet-ups. She had to get it down on paper. Bechdel discovered a copy of <em>Gay Comix</em>, a compilation of comic art by gay men and lesbians, and felt inspired to do it herself.

<br/><br/>

For 25 years, <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em> followed the highs and lows, ins and outs of American lesbian culture, and it was here she introduced the Bechdel Test, which a film or book can only pass if it features two women who have a conversation about something other than a man (now used widely to point out sexist media).

<br/><br/>

Today, Bechdel seems to be a little mystified, if not heart-warmed, by her success. In 1981, the job of nerdy com artist hardly seemed to be a clever career choice, but over the years, Bechdel's work has met with huge acclaim. Her comic has a huge cult following and <em>Fun Home</em> was made into a hit Broadway musical. Bechdel has shown that, in popular culture, there is a place for the geeky lesbian in all her glory.</p>

<h1>Gladys Bentley</h1>

<p>To Harry Hansberry's Clam House, Manhattan, the tiny 1920's gay speakeasy where larger than life blues performer Gladys Bentley (1907-1960) sang her way to fame. Big, black, openly gay dressed up in men's clothes, Bentley was an unlikely star of the shadowy prohibition underworld.

<br/><br/>

Moving from Philadelphia to Harlem when she was 16, Bentley found herself slap bang in a burgeoning artistic and free-living African American community. It was also New York's epicentre of vice; its network of speakeasies was the perfect place to drink a Top & Bottom (gin and wine), smoke weed, attend drag balls and see the greatest and naughtiest talents perform. By the late 20's, Bentley had recorded a number of 78s, had a radio show and found her notoriety allowed her to wear whatever she liked; usually a tux and top hat. In the early 30's she upgraded headlining at swankier clubs backed by a posse of drag queens, but it was in 1931 that things got really interesting. Rumours abounded that Bentley had got hitched to a white woman in a civil partnership in New Jersey - decades before same sex marriage was legalised.

<br/><br/>

So far, so queer, but in a 1954 article in <em>Ebony</em> magazine, Bentley attempted to destroy her gay persona. Suddenly, she was cured of 'her strange affliction', had married a man and appeared in a photoshoot doing household chores. What had become of the lioness of a woman? Had the puritanism of the McCarthy era force her to put on another costume, that of a clean-living, dutiful wife? Or perhaps Bentley was showing she still had the energy to shock, provoke and mystify, right up to her death in 1960.</p>

<h1>Sandra Bernhard</h1>

<p>Sandra Bernhard (born 1955) is the gangly American performer, author and activist who came to fame in the 1970's with her searing stand-up shows, cutting through the hairy-balled comedy fraternity with a brash, female skew. In between the punchlines, Bernhard is known for being furiously 'outspoken' (something her male counterparts might not be charged wth), but it's a quality that has made her stand out as a hugely creative and political talent.

<br/><br/>

In 1977, Bernhard's stand-up act scored her a place on <em>The Richard Pryor Show</em>, but it was in 1983 that she shot to fame in Scorsese's <em>The King of Comedy</em> as Masha, a suitably creepy stalker. A slew of one-woman shows followed and Bernhard's star was in the ascendant. It's best not to define Bernhard through her friendship with one-time gal pal Madonna, but it was that - and rumours of a relationship - which excited the tabloid press and pushed Bernhard's celebrity even further.

<br/><br/>

Bernhard has a daughter with her longtime female partner, is a vocal supporter of gay equality and broke new ground playing Nancy in <em>Roseanne</em>, one of the first lesbian characters in a prime-time sitcom. In the early 90's she took somewhat of an unexpected turn, popping up in <em>Playboy</em>, but then hit big on Broadway with another stand-up show, critiquing the great and good of the worlds of politics and celebrity. Bernhard is at her best when she lays into lofty untouchables, pointing out hypocrisy with humour and buckets of personality. She has always been a risk-taker in ways most contemporary comics are not, and she doesn't care if you're offended. Just the way it should be.</p>

<h1>Justin Vivian Bond</h1>

<p>Award-winning performer, artist, writer and activist Justin Vivian Bond (born 1963) has sparkled in the spotlight for more than three decades. Crooning in the smoky dive bars, draped across a piano wailing out <em>Smells Like Teen Spirit</em> or <em>Space Oddity</em>, Bond's husky, gin-soaked creation Kiki DuRane became a cult figure on the 90's and 00's cabaret circuit as one half of award-winning act Kiki & Herb. Cult indie movies, solo art shows and a book followed. Over the years, Bond has cultivated an influential body of work, from writing to original music - even a fragrance.

<br/><br/>

Growing up trans in the Maryland suburbs of the 1970's, Bond seemed to defy gender norms with every step, every utterance. As a young boy who wore frosted pink lipstick to school (Iced Watermelon by Revlon FYI), Bond twirled like Fred and Ginger, hoping to be both, fooled around with local boys and came of age in the crosshairs of bullies and a conservative family. If Bond's autobiography <em>Tango: My Childhood, Backwards and in High Heels</em> (2011) reveals a child who danced right up to the boundaries of gender, as an adult, Bond has foxtrotted over them entirely.

<br/><br/>

As a trailblazer of trans expression, non-binary language and new pronouns (Bond prefers 'mx' and 'v'), and champion  feminism and civil rights, Bond cuts a persuasive, eloquent figure. Self-described as a 'trans-genre' artist - a nifty term, ripe with meaning, yet open to interpretation - Bond has an almost indefinable quality. There's the political satirist, the accomplished artist, and the passionate activist. But there's also lipstick and glitter, lonesome love songs, and just a little bit of magic.</p>

<h1>Leigh Bowery</h1>

<p>'Modern art on legs' is how Boy George once described Leigh Bowery (1961-94), the voluptuous fashion icon, performance artist and full-time outrage-machine. As fellow club creatures George had a dance floor's eye view of Bowery, and witnessed his evolution from nightlife personality to international art superstar.

<br/><br/>

Born in Sunshine, Australia, Bowery was lured to London by the burgeoning post-punk scene and set about constructing a new, polka-dotted, queer persona for himself. For each appearance, Bowery rebuilt his plump form with makeup, masks and costume, adding wigs, dripping paint or deformities, each look more outrageous than before. As a performer, just when it seemed he couldn't go any further, he would. From 'giving birth' on stage to performing an enema on himself, and then spraying down the audience, Bowery delighted and infuriated in equal measure.

<br/><br/>

Stories of the 1980's London creative scene always seem to have Bowery at the heart: his short-lived club night Taboo, a two-week stint at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery where he posed behind a two-way mirror, and becoming the muse of painter Lucien Freud who, it is said, was romanced by Bowery's legs. Defying convention at every turn, Bowery powered his art, design and everyday existence with an unshakable sense of self. Bowery described himself as gay, but married his long-time friend Nicola Bateman in 1994, months before his death from an AIDs-related illness on New Year's Eve.

<br/><br/>

His legacy lives on through the people he left behind, from Sue Tilley (his friend, champion and also a model for Lucien Freud), to the designers, performers and artists who were lucky enough to bear witness to Bowery's technicolour greatness.</p>
