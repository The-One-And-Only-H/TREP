<h1>Laverne Cox</h1>

<p>'I'm a black transgender chick from Mobile, Alabama, I grew up poor and working class, and I'm on the cover of magazines,' says actor, performer, writer producer and civil rights activist Laverne Cox (born 1972). At a time when gender is re-examined, trans stories are finally heard and new social theories, bathroom laws and pronouns abound, there have been few unifying voices. Cox, a natural orator (read: charmer), has sought to build bridges as much as she has crossed swords, often taking a deep breath when she could quite rightly snap.

<br/><br/>

We listen to Cox because she's <em>been there</em>. She was dreadfully bullied as a child and attempted suicide at 11, but made her way through using dance and performance. She moved to NYC in her late teens and began her transition. Acting gave Cox a platform to finally speak out. In 2013, cult women's TV drama <em>Orange is the New Black</em> launched Cox into the mainstream, and ever since she's perfectly calibrated her celebrity with talk shows, awards ceremonies and lectures, alongside her hair-flicking, basque-wearing wild side.

<br/><br/>

Modern media indicates a growing acceptance of trans people; <em>Time</em> magazine called it a 'tipping point' when they put Cox on the cover in 2014 - but she's quick to point out this acceptance has limits. Those celebratory <em>you go, girl</em> outpourings are generally reserved for trans women who can easily pass as female; who are glossy, sexy and stylish, with dream hair - like Cox. But using her own visibility, Cox consistently draws our attention to the other: trans people who do not fit the mould, from incarcerated sex workers to teens battling bathroom bills. Passionate and engaging, Cox reminds us that not fitting in and struggling to be your authentic self is something we can all relate to.</p>

<h1>Quentin Crisp</h1>

<p>All suburbanites dream of escape and Quentin Crisp (1908-99) was no exception. Born Denis Pratt, he set about reinventing himself into a refined, pastel-hued queer creature of the likes unseen on the streets of south London. A little lipstick here, a dab of nail polish there and a new, impossibly fey-sounding name marked Crisp out as something of a gender pioneer of the time.

<br/><br/>

In his twenties, Crisp struggled to hold down a job, studying journalism and art and, through hanging out in the cafes of Soho, became a sex worker too. He entertained London's 'brightest and roughest' (according to his diaries) from his tiny flat and worked on sharpening his wit. Escaping conscription because of 'sexual perversion', Crisp loved wartime London and his affection for US culture apparently stemmed from his night-time fumbles with American GIs. His notoriety grew; Crisp published three short books and by 1968 he was the subject of a documentary, but it was the 1975 film adaptation of Crisp's <em>The Naked Civil Servant</em> starring John Hurt that secured the raconteur's stardom. He toured a show about his life and moved to New York in 1981, listing his name in the telephone directory so he could accept any invitation he received, from dinners (he loved a free meal) to film appearances.

<br/><br/>

Crisp's soft, floppy-hatted exterior and delicate mauve hair belied  shrewd wit and somewhat dark ideals. He loved to be controversial; he made laugh, but furiously angry too. He seemed at odds with contemporary gay liberation rhetoric, and when challenged, hardened his views. In his final years, he failed to grasp the shift in attitudes towards queer civil equality; to him, the AIDs crisis was 'a fad', and gay men had 'feminine minds'. Yet, he struck to his guns. There had always been something immovable about Crisp and it took unbelievable courage to walk the streets of 1920's London as his true, flamboyant self. He was a man who refused to be anyone else.</p>
