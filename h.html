<h1>Radclyffe Hall</h1>

<p>Many a geeky young lesbian has plumbed <em>The Well of Loneliness</em> (1928), Radclyffe Hall's taboo-breaking and gender-busting literary classic. It charts the life of Stephen, an upper class young woman who finds love in the arms of Mary, an older ambulance driver, only for the pair to suffer isolation and rejection from a cruel world. Hall hoped it might encourage a 'more tolerant understanding' of queer people, and thought she had 'put [her] pen at the service of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world.' It didn't go down well. Deemed a 'danger to the nation', Hall's novel was banned four months after publication, after medical advice that it could lead women to become lesbians. It was finally released in 1949.

<br/><br/>

Born in 1880 to wealth and privilege, Hall's status allowed her a certain eccentricity: what we might read as fantastically queer today was nothing more than fascinatingly odd at the time. Hall dressed in men's clothing (she wore a leather riding coat and Spanish riding hat to <em>The Well's</em> censorship court case), called herself 'John', lived with her female partner Una Troubridge, and appeared in photographs and artworks in her bespoke, masculine finery. <em>The Well</em> was a risk, however; it might have exposed Hall and Una as lesbians, but she felt compelled to publish it. Una ad Hall stayed together until Hall's death in 1943, leaving a legacy of gender-bending imagery and the world's most influential lesbian tragic novel.</p>

<h1>Keith Haring</h1>

<p>Gawky art hero Keith Haring (1958-90) is the bespectacled subway scrawler whose cartoonish drawings of birth, death, love, sex and freedom became synonymous with the creative renaissance of 1980's New York. Through hundreds of works created in white chalk across the NYC transport system and beyond, Haring's raw, vibrant style marked him out as a queer, sex-positive artist who dealt in social justice.

<br/><br/>

Haring moved to New York City in 1978, enrolled at the School of Visual Arts, and soon discovered a growing grungy, alt-art community on the Lower East Side. Befriending artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, as well as graffiti writers, and performers like Fab 5 Freddy and Madonna, Haring became a major figure on the scene, the organising group exhibitions and happenings. Four years after arriving in New York, Haring's first major show attracted the likes of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

<br/><br/>

It was the subway where Haring developed his art. His crawling 'radiant' babies, UFOs and spiky-toothed dogs became a familiar sight for commuting New Yorkers, and Haring became increasingly dedicated to public art, accessible to all. Soon, he was travelling the world creating new works for hospitals, children's centres and charities, and took part in more than 100 solo and group exhibitions.

<br/><br/>

In 1988, Haring was diagnosed with AIDs and the following year set up the Keith Haring Foundation to provide funding and artworks to AIDs organisations. He died one year later at the age of 31.

<br/><br/>

Haring's imagery played a huge part in the activism and awareness surrounding AIDs. To this day, his foundation supports not-for-profits that help under-privileged children and organisations that focus on AIDs education, prevention and care.</p>

<h1>Essex Hemphill</h1>

<p>Essex Hemphill (1957-95) is the gay poet and activist whose angry, explicit, autobiographical works went where few had gone before: he power-punched anti-gay attitudes, sexual objectification and racism, and helped define the experience of black gay men during the AIDs epidemic.

<br/><br/>

Hemphill started to write in his teens; it was during a reading at Howard University, Washington, in 1980 that he first talked about being gay. His sensual, erotic poems and essays dealt with the anti-gay mindset of straight black men and the objectification of black men by the white gay community. No one was safe: Hemphill unpicked the work of celebrated queer photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, pointing out his images of black men were all dick, no face. And Jennie Livingston's legendary (and much loved) 1990 drag doc <em>Paris is Burning</em>, according to Hemphill, revealed that the black drag performer's sassy imitations were 'materialistic, Caucasian and consumer' in nature.

<br/><br/>

In the late 80's, Hemphill brought energetic, visceral performances of his own work to small Washington DC venues, and - as his notoriety grew - to New York and London. His editing of anthology <em>Brother to Brother</em> (1991) won a Lambda literary award and his first full-length book, <em>Ceremonies</em> (1992), picked up the National Library Association's Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual New Author Award.

<br/><br/>

Although something of a hidden hero, Hemphill has had an everlasting effect, inspiring other creatives from artists to performers - Justin Vivian Bond's dark, angry song <em>American Wedding</em> (2011) is powered by Hemphill's poetry, reimagined in a dark, angry drawl. Yet, as much as he inspired, he also provoked, and Hemphill's harsh takedown of race, sexuality and masculinity is as uncomfortable and relevant as ever.</p>

<h1>Patricia Highsmith</h1>

<p>In 1952, using the pseudonym Claire Morgan, Patricia Highsmith (1921-95), published a work of fiction the likes of which the world had never seen: a sexy, heart-breaking lesbian novel with a happy ending. In <em>The Price of Salt</em>, the gay American novelist and short story writer - whose works are considered the finest, most nail-biting example of suspense lit - drew on her own sultry entanglements with former lovers in the glamorous 1950s Greenwich Village.

<br/><br/>

Born in Texas, Highsmith maintained a lifelong love-hate relationship with her mother (who died just four years before Highsmith). Graduating from women's liberal arts college Barnard in 1942, Highsmith wrote short stories and comics, and struggled to secure a job in journalism. Encouraged by Truman Capote, in 1948 Highsmith gained a place on the Yaddo arts retreat where she worked on her first novel, the best-selling <em>Strangers on a Train</em> (1950). A year later, Hitchcock released the movie version - a smash hit. Not bad for a debut novelist.

<br/><br/>

'The poet of apprehension' is how Graham  Greene once described Highsmith's writing, but this seemed to be true socially, too. She was a mercurial dinner guest, dry and funny one minute, and cruel the next. Biographers talk of trouble with alcohol and depression, and an inability to have long-term relationships, but Highsmith's output was consistently impressive. She wrote more than 20 novels, inspiring big-budget movie adaptations, created iconic characters like Tom Ripley, and apparently had time to break hearts across New York.

<br/><br/>

<em>The Price of Salt</em> was inspired by an icy blonde woman in a mink whom Highsmith spotted while working at Bloomingdales as a young shop girl, much like the character Therese in the novel. Thirty-eight years after its debut, near the end of Highsmith's life, the world had changed. Highsmith decided that <em>Salt</em>, her most personal novel, be republished as <em>Carol</em> (1990), but this time under her real name.</p>

<h1>Rock Hudson</h1>

<p>Rock Hudson (1925-85) is the impossibly handsome screen idol of Hollywood's golden age who - like many of his contemporaries - infamously hid his sexuality from plain sight.

<br/><br/>

Director Douglas Sirk gave Hudson his first starring role in <em>Magnificent Obsession</em> (1954), but his star power became obvious after the release of <em>Giant</em> (1956), which scored him an Oscar nomination. Hudson's carefully crafted celeb persona was pure box-office gold: he was tall and broad-chested, with a superhero's jawline, a deep, masculine voice, and a sense of humour. Studios were careful to cast him in tough-yet sensitive roles. He was the perfect heart-throb, romantically linked to any number of glamorous Hollywood women, and caused hearts to flutter and knickers to fizz all over the world. Yet, when Hudson's sexuality was eventually revealed, the true construction of his on-screen character was laid bare.

<br/><br/>

Hudson was, in part, the creation of Henry Wilson, and one of a long line of (mainly gay) men the uber-agent deftly rebuilt and renamed, from Tab Hunter to Dack Rambo. Each was given a manly resume and schooled in the art of acting straight, but it was Hudson through which Wilson had his greatest success.

<br/><br/>

Later in his career, Hudson appeared in a handful of films, but by the early 1980's his health had deteriorated. Then came a turning point: in 1985, Hudson announced he had HIV. The idea that a beloved national treasure like Hudson could have AIDs was a huge shock, but Hudson's bravery in finally speaking out helped to de-stigmatise the illness, and opened up dialogue about what it meant to be gay in contemporary America. He died the same year.</p>
