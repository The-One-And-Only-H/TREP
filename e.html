<h1>Lili Elbe</h1>

<p>Lili Elbe (1882-1931) is the Danish artist and gender pioneer whose brave social and physical transformation and frank personal diaries have inspired others across the decades.

<br/><br/>

Known as Einar Mogens Wegener, the tenacious and ambitious teenage boy swapped a sleepy fjord-side village to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It was there Einar fell for fellow artist Gerda Gottlieb - the pair married n 1904 - and their life together was full of colour, art and rather fancy dresses.

<br/><br/>

Privately, Einar would model women's clothing for Gerda's high-fashion illustrations, and her subsequent works offered a glimpse into another world, a world where she was a woman. The pair moved to Paris in 1912 and, after years trying to suppress the inner identity Einar named Lili, Paris seemed the perfect place to transition into her true self. Lili finally stepped out of the shadows and, with Gerda, into the nightlife of upscale Paris society.

<br/><br/>

In the 1920's, Lili discovered the possibility of surgically altering her body at the German Institute for Sexual Science in Berlin. The term 'transsexualism' was coined by the clinic's founder, gay rights activist Dr Magnus Hirschfield. Lili underwent a series of pioneering operations both at the Institute and at the Dresden clinic of Kurt Warnekros (a man she described as her 'saviour') in 1930-31.

<br/><br/>

Yet, as Lili blossomed, her old life began to unravel. Friends rejected her, she was granted a divorce and her family desperately missed Einar, their beloved brother and son. She became untethered to the past and struggled to find acceptance. A final operation ended her life in September 1931. Earlier that summer, Lili had written to a friend. 'That I, Lili, am vital and have a right to life I have proved by living for 14 months,' she explained. 'It may be said that 14 months is not much, but they seem to me like a whole and happy human life.'</p>
