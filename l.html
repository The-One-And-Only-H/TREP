<h1>KD Lang</h1>

<p>'Elvis is alive and she's beautiful,' said Madonna of KD Lang (Kathryn Dawn Lang; born 1961). It was the height of Lang's fame and the handsome Canadian  with the sensuous, Patsy Kline drawl was, quite simply, the world's most famous lesbian. In the mid 90's, the quiet country singer - and queer culture itself - was having a bit of a moment. Lang's <em>Ingénue</em> (1992), her multi-million-selling, Grammy-winning album, saw her draped in supermodels and celebs, attending fashion shows, falling out of boozy parties - even shot by Herb Ritts for the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em> (1993) being shaved by Cindy Crawford.

<br/><br/>

Lang grew up on the prairie lands of Edmonton and formed a band, The Reclines, in 1983. She worked her own brand of 'cowboy punk' in kitsch outfits, started picking up awards, and recorded 'Crying', a duet with Roy Orbison, in 1987. She then starred in queer cult classic <em>Salmonberries</em> (1991), and the legendary coming-out episode of <em>Ellen</em> (1997).

<br/><br/>

At the height of her fame, Lang ran the cool kids: she counted actor and comedian Sandra Bernhard and Madonna as friends, and 'lesbian chic' was a thing. After <em>Ingénue</em>, she used her new star power to become a spokesperson for lesbian and gay issues, animal rights and human rights in Tibet. Although the press has stopped frothing about Lang (and the huge gains made in the 90's towards the visibility of gay people in mainstream media have proved a little fickle), the effect Lang and her music had on a generation of queer kids should not be underestimated.</p>

<h1>Audre Lorde</h1>

<p>Just before her death, poet, feminist, activist and 'crazy and queer' hero Audre Lorde (1934-92) took a new name in an African naming ceremony . She became known as Gamba Adisa, meaning Warrior: She Who Makes Her Meaning Known. In the final throes of cancer, she had spent a life-time defining meaning, not just for herself, but for the others who loved her angry poetry and emotional (and rather sexy) prose. She unpicked the fabric of race, gender and sexuality, and sought to make something that had not existed before. 'I started writing,' she said, 'because I had a need inside of me to create something that was not there.'

<br/><br/>

Lorde was born in New York into the kind of tricky family dynamics needed to be a truly wonderful writer: her light-skinned mother was distrustful of her daughter's own darker skin and her father was cold and distant. As a writer and performer, Lorde was deadly serious one minute, and light and coquettish the next. Today, she might be read as an intersectional feminist - holding the belief that oppressive institutions (such as racism and sexism) are interconnected and cannot be examined individually. Lorde was dogged in the fighting of all prejudice, not only in mainstream culture, but within feminism too. Her techniques were powerful, from the unapologetic way she might underline her identity as a 'black feminist lesbian mother poet' in readings and debates, to how she might split up her usually all-female audiences, asking black women to stay after a performance and introduce themselves, forging new relationships.

<br/><br/>

In 1984, Lorde moved to Berlin; racism in Europe, specifically Germany, became a flashpoint in her work, but she loved the city and the vitality of the German women's movement. She felt free. After she died, Lorde left a legacy of writing, readings and debates that sought to uncover the truth about the way we live.</p>
